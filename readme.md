This repository is up to date as of November 2020.

This repository holds all of the core notes I made while going through the exam objectives for revision. It doesn't include practical exercises and things like that. There are good practicals available through Hashicorp directly using the links above.

At the time of writing I have used Terraform professionally on and off for the past 3 years in various contexts. Mostly for AWS and more recently for Kubernetes and Helm. And so there are places in the notes where I take certain concepts or information for granted. Hopefully this can still be a useful resource for others.
